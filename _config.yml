  Hi, I'm Dario and I'm a backend developer and system administrator. I also do frontend development (somewhat reluctantly ðŸ˜œ). 
  
  I'm currently working at/for [rechnerherz](https://www.rechnerherz.at/) and [MediPrime](https://www.mediprime.eu/).
  
  I enjoy working with Java/Kotlin (preferably Kotlin), JavaScript/TypeScript (preferably TypeScript), and Spring.

      $ Nothing can go wrng|

more_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  Besides programming, some of my hobbies are cycling, board games, and Kung Fu ðŸ‘ŠðŸ¤š.
  
  I like to keep my private life private, so you won't find much about me on social media.
